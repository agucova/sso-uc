# UC SSO Helper üîê

A python library for easily authenticating to services protected by UC Chile's SSO system.

## Installation

The library is available on PyPi:

```shell
$ pip install uc-sso-helper
```

## Usage

The library exposes two main functions:

- `get_ticket(username, password, service_url)`: To get a service ticket and an authenticated service URL given a username and password.
- `get_user_info(username, password)`: To get SSO stored user attributes.

The library is typed and the [code](https://github.com/agucova/sso-uc/blob/main/uc_sso_helper/main.py) is relatively short and documented.

### Example: Portal UC

A minimal example to place an authenticated GET request to UC Chile's main portal.

```python
import requests
from uc_sso_helper import get_ticket

ticket = get_ticket("example_username", "example_password", "https://portal.uc.cl/")
requests.get(ticket.service_url).text
```
